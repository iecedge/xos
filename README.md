# XOS

XOS is a framework for operationalizing a collection of 
disaggregated services. It is packaged as a project in
the Open CORD initiative, with source code managed through
`https://gerrit.opencord.org`. It is also mirrored at
`https://github.com/opencord`.

You can download and use XOS either as part of CORD (see the
[CORD Guide](https://guide.opencord.org/) for details) 
or as a standalone component (see the
[XOS Guide](https://guide.xosproject.org/) for details).
Also visit the
[XOS Wiki Page](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/XOS+and+the+CORD+Controller)
for additional information.
